					<br>
					<br>
					<p>This Mednefits Privacy Policy (“Privacy policy”) describes the information Medicloud Pte Ltd or Mednefits Pte Ltd (“Mednefits” or "Mednefits Insurance Agency" or “we” or “us”) gathers from you (“you” or “You”) when you use the Mednefits website, mobile or other applications, related services (together, the “Mednefits Applications”), and insurance services, or when you interact through Mednefits with service providers in the health and wellness sector (“Service Provider(s)”) who provide you services (the “Services”), and how we use, process, and disclose that information. We may add to or revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. We may also post additional privacy statements for some portions of the Mednefits Applications.</p>

					<p><b>Information We Collect</b></p>

					<p>When you create an account and use the Mednefits Applications, you consent to Mednefits, Mednefits-related companies, and their respective agents or representatives collecting, using, storing, transferring and disclosing your personal data to all such persons necessary for the purpose of enabling Mednefits to provide you with the Services. The information which we collect from you or other sources include:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>Name;</li>
						<li>Information that we can use to identify or contact you such as your email address and phone number;</li>
						<li>Demographics information such as your gender and location and device related information;</li>
						<li>Personal Information, and Personal Health Information if you decide to provide such information to us for use with the Mednefits Applications and the Services;</li>
						<li>Any other information or Content, such as photos, images, reviews, topics, content, and bio, you provide us.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>You are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the information you submit to Mednefits. Inaccurate information will affect your experience when using the Mednefits Applications and our ability to contact you as described in this Privacy Policy. You may also be asked to provide authorization for uses of information in addition to what is in this Privacy Policy when you use certain features of the Mednefits Applications.</p>


					<p>If you create an account using, or otherwise connect your account to, a social networking services account (e.g. Twitter, Facebook or Google) we may also collect information provided to us by such social networking service including for example your: name; email address; birthday; geographic location; interests; profile picture; gender; networks; user ID; list of friends; likes, comments and any information you have made public and made accessible to us on such social networking account. We may combine information received from you when using the Mednefits Applications with information from external sources.</p>

					<p>We automatically collect information about how you use our Mednefits Applications, for example, pages you have viewed. We also collect certain technical information about your device including your Internet protocol address, geo-location information, your browser type, language and identifying information, your operating system and application version, device types, device model and manufacturer, device identifiers, and your device operating system type and version.</p>

					<p>We also use cookies, Web beacons, URL information or other technologies
					to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the information for which you searched and which you viewed. Cookies are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent cookies (which usually stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience. Web beacons are digital images that are used to log information on the Mednefits Applications or in our emails. We use Web beacons to manage cookies, count visits, and to learn what marketing works and what does not. We also use Web beacons to tell if you open or act on our emails.</p>

					<p>Others, including third party analytics service providers and advertising partners, may also collect personally identifiable information about your online activities over time and across different Web sites when you use our Mednefits Applications, including as described in this Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to and we are not responsible for those other parties. Third party analytics services may use cookies and web beacons through our Mednefits Applications (for example, we may use Google Analytics, HubSpot, or similar services). We encourage you to review the privacy policies of these third parties to learn about your choices about information these types of services collect from you.</p>

					<p><b>How Mednefits Discloses Your Information</b></p>

					<p>We may share your information as follows:</p>

					<ul>
						<li>We may share your information with your consent or at your direction.
						<li>We may also share your information with others who perform services on our behalf.
						<li>We may disclose your information if we believe we are required to do so by law, or to comply with a court order, judicial or other government subpoena, or warrant.
						<li>We also may disclose your information if we believe doing so is appropriate or necessary to prevent any liability, or fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or to protect Mednefits and our Mednefits Applications; or any rights, property, or personal safety of Mednefits or others.
						<li>In the event that Mednefits is or may be acquired by or merged with another company or involved in any other business deal (or negotiation of a business deal) involving the sale or transfer of all or part of our business or assets, we may transfer or assign your information as part of or in connection with the transaction. Finally, in the event of insolvency, bankruptcy, or receivership, information may be transferred or disclosed as a business asset.
						<li>We may also share aggregated and anonymized data with our partners, advertisers, and other third parties.

						<li>We will not disclose Service Provider calendar information (including names, or other information), or use Service Provider external calendar information other than using appointment times to avoid double-booking, and to make the display of a combined calendar convenient for Service Providers.</li>
					</ul>

					<p><b>Security</b></p>

					<p>Mednefits takes commercially reasonable steps to help protect your information against loss, misuse and unauthorized access, or disclosure. No company can fully prevent security risks, however. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. To help protect yourself and your information, choose a unique password for our Mednefits Applications and do not use a password on our Mednefits Applications that you would use on any other website or online service.</p>

					<p><b>Dispute Resolution</b></p>

					<p>If you believe that Mednefits has not adhered to this Statement, please contact Mednefits by e-mail at happiness@mednefits.com. We will do our best to address your concerns. If you feel that your complaint has been addressed incompletely, we invite you to let us know for further investigation.</p>

You may opt out of receiving such messages from Mednefits by following the instructions in those messages. If you opt out, we may still send you non-commercial electronic messages, such as messages about your accounts, bookings or our ongoing business relations. Please note that deletion of your information or content does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of the content or information posted on the Services.</p>

					<p>When you use and Mednefits Applications, we and others give you the following choices about use of mechanisms for tracking, including tracking of your online activities over time and across different websites and online services by third parties. Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies from Mednefits or from third parties. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features of the Mednefits Applications and the Mednefits Applications may not function. You can also choose to opt-out of use of cookies by some of our third party advertising partners to deliver ads tailored to your profile and preferences. However, while we and others give you choices as described in this policy, there are many ways in which Web browser signals and other similar mechanisms can indicate your choice to disable tracking, and our Mednefits Applications may not be aware of or honor every mechanism.</p>

					<p><b>Minors</b></p>

					<p>We will not knowingly collect information from users under the age of 13. If we discover that we have collected information from a user under the age of 13, we will delete such information.</p>

					<p><b>Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy</b></p>

					<p>From time to time, we may revise the Policy. To help you stay current of any changes, we note the date the Privacy Policy was last updated above. </p>
