At all times, however, you will pay Mednefits a transaction fee that is a percentage of the amounts that you earn for providing your Services to Customers who book their appointments (or otherwise connect with you) by means of the Mednefits Applications. Where a Customer first comes to you through Mednefits (“Mednefits Originating Customer”), the transaction fee may be higher compared to the transaction fee applicable when a pre-existing customer of yours adopts Mednefits. Mednefits will provide notice to you of the amount of the transaction fee, including any changes to it from time to time. Mednefits may change the amount of the Mednefits Applications usage fee and the transaction fee at any time (and from time to time) on 30 days’ written notice.</p>

					<p class="padding-left-90">a. Pricing of your individual Services to Customers is set by Service Providers, and is not the responsibility of Mednefits. You agree, however, that your prices charged to Mednefits Originating Customers for your Services will be equal to or less than the prices you charge your other clients who did not, or do not, come to you initially through Mednefits.</p>

					<p class="padding-left-90">b. After your Service is delivered to the Mednefits Customer, and you indicate to Mednefits the Service is completed, Mednefits will bill your Customer’s through Mednefits credit system first, and you will collect the balance if any using any payment method of choice. Mednefits will then remit your portion of Mednefits credit system billing amount to you, after retaining the transaction fee and relevant tax amount.</p>

					<p class="padding-left-50"><b>14. Appointment of Mednefits as Limited Payment Collection Agent.</b> You hereby appoint Mednefits as your limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the payment for the provision of Your Services to Customers booked through the Mednefits Applications (the “Service Fees”). You agree that payment made by a Customer through Mednefits, including any third party payment processing provider used by Mednefits to facilitate payment, shall be considered the same as payment made directly to you and you will make Your Services available to the Customer in the agreed-upon manner as if you had received the Service Fees directly. You agree that Mednefits may, in accordance with the applicable cancellation policy as provided to you on the Mednefits Applications, (i) permit the Customer to cancel the booking and (ii) refund (via Mednefits) to the Customer that portion of the Service Fees specified in the applicable cancellation policy. You understand that Mednefits accepts payments from Customers only as your limited payment collection agent and that Mednefits’s obligation to pay you is subject to and conditional upon successful receipt of the associated payments from Customers.

The correct application of the appropriate taxes is your sole responsibility.</b> You are obligated to collect any applicable tax from Customers and remit it to applicable governments; it is also your sole responsibility to determine if a particular Service is taxable or not. Mednefits will collect taxes on your behalf from Customers and remit these funds to you. You are obligated to remit the relevant tax to applicable governments.

Operation of Service.</b> Mednefits reserves the right to change, suspend, remove or disable access to the Mednefits Applications and any Content and Materials for any reason, including but not limited to complaints or allegations of infringement or other unlawful conduct, without liability to you, and at any time without notice.
